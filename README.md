# Database

In this repo we are going to see how we can persist the data inside a database and use it offline. First we will cover the SQLite database which is by default already available in iOS.
Then we will see the implementation of Code Data in iOS, a framework on the top of SQLite Database.

In this project we will add SQLite3 dependency as an embedded binary in our workspace.

## SQLite Database

- In comes by default with iOS, it adds no overhead to the app's bundle.
- SQLite release version 1.0 in August 2000, so it is tried and tested.
- Well maintained with frequent releases.
- Open source.
- It's uses query language that's familiar to database developer and administrators.
- Cross platform, it is used in both iOS and Android.
